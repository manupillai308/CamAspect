 # Smart Security Surveillance System
  ## A centralized system for human identification and tracking.
Person detection and tracking is one of the most important research field that has gained a lot of attention in recent years. There are lot of  surveillance cctv cameras installed around us thus, it is necessary to develop a computer vision based technology that automatically processes the real time video frames in order to track the person.
Here, we aim to build an intelligent system which has its own secure database system, a cctv network and a network of connected nodes(systems). Each node will be connected to the centralized system. Node will be used by authorized personnel with their login credentials for their authorized operations in the system(searching,tagging,etc)

  ## Objectives:
  #### 1.Developing a centralised mainframe
  It will be installed on a single centralised machine where the main algorithm will be running and the database is
  accessed. This will be connected to the nodes from which the authorized personnel will get access to the system.
  #### 2.Algorithm-Human identification and tracking system
The algorithm will detect humans in the cctv footage frames and will search the database for identification of people in the live video footage. If there is one person of interest in the live feed, there will be an option to select that individual and only track activities of that person. After tracking, the algorithm will upload the logs of tracking to the database, in the tracked person/people’s records.
  #### 3.Software system for each node: To be installed in individual systems or ‘nodes’. Here, authorized personnel will perform operations. As per login credentials, access rights will be defined for the user.
CCTV surveillance system provides the real-time recording as well as online access by the staff to  monitor  more intelligently that would eventually reduce the risk of crime.

## Expected Outcome:
Tracking is used by governments for intelligence gathering, the prevention of crime, the protection of a  process,  person,  group  or  object,  or  for  the investigation of  crime. Fields of interest include:-
### General  civil use
Smart Surveillance systems can be used in local residences, complexes, societies, schools, colleges, etc.
 ### Government Authorities
Provide easy assistance to security systems in government owned properties like Offices, Police Stations, etc.
### Airports/Railway Stations
Adds a security layer of intelligent security tracking system to the airports and railway stations.
### Military Applications
Military applications include CCTV tracking system powered by customized database, according to the authority’s requirements.
### Commercial Properties
Smart Survellance systems provide instant assistance in security and surveillance systems in company buildings, complexes, etc.
### Smart cities
Such intelligent systems always act as a step ahead in the developement of smart cities, thus attracting more and more scientific researchers to invest huge funds in research related to intelligent video surveillance.
